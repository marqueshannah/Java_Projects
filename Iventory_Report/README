# Inventory Report
## Description:
This project is a Java program that processes inventory data and generates an inventory report. The program reads data from two input files: items.txt and activity.txt. It performs various operations based on the activity records and updates the inventory accordingly. Finally, it creates an inventory report file containing the updated inventory information.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`

2. Compile the Java source code:
`javac HMProjectThree.java`

3. Run the program:

`java HMProjectThree`

4. Follow the prompts to enter the file paths for items.txt, activity.txt, and the desired path for the report file.

5. The program will process the input files, update the inventory, and generate the inventory report.

6. The inventory report will be saved to the specified report file path.
